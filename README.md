# hello-world
my first git hub repository
I am Toba. Trying to learn a bit about programming, more on the hardware programming side.
I really hope to do lots of great things with programming hardware skill, like helping young folks, undergraduates etc to develop, create cool stuff and apply time to creating stuff.
